# Chapter 3, Physical symbol system

##Physical Symbol system

* What is a symbol system?
  * It contains Patterns (symbols) stored in structures (expressions) and processes
  *  structures (expression) -> manipulates (processes) -> new structure 
  * A physical symbol system hypothesis states that a PSS has sufficent means for intelligent actions
  * Ex - Formal logic, algebra, digital computer, chess, human thought, AI - agent
  * In humans symbols = thoughts, processes = thinking 
  * In agent symbols  = data, processes = programs

* Designation - An expression designates an object if the system can alter or depend on the object
* Interpretation - The system can interpretat an expression if the expression designates a process that the system can preform.
* Necessary - Any system exhibiting intelligence will prove to be a PSS
* Sufficient - any PSS of sufficient size can be made to exhibit general intelligence

* Evidence by Newell and Simon that "symbol manipulation" exits in humans and AI
  * Very complex symbol system AIs exist can simulate intelligence
  * Psychologi sugest that human problem solving uses symbol manipulation
