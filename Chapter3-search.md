##Physical Symbol system

* What is a symbol system?
  * Patterns (symbols) stored in structures (expressions) -> manipulates (processes) -> new structure
  * A physical symbol system has sufficent means for intelligent actions
  * Ex - Formal logic, algebra, digital computer, chess, human thought, AI - agent
  * In humans symbols = thoughts, processes = thinking 
  * In agent symbols  = data, processes = programs

* Evidence by Newell and Simon that "symbol manipulation" exits in humans and AI
  * Very complex symbol system AIs exist can simulate intelligence
  * Psychologi sugest that human problem solving uses symbol manipulation
