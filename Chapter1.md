# Chapter 1 Introduction

##AI
* What is AI?
  * AI is an atempt to build intelligent agents/entities.
  * It's a new field.
  * There are four diffrent aproaches to AI
  
 || Human-centered | Rationality centered  |
 |---|---|---|
 |Thougt process|  Systems that think humanly | systems that think rationally  |

## Turing

*The turing test
 * First mentioned in an article by Alan Turing in 1950
 * The goal of the test is to provide a satisfactory defenition of intelligence
 * A person C must decide which of player A and B is human and whom is a compluter.
 * Many variants.

* To complete the test an agent must master the following disciplins
 * Natural langague processing
 * Knowledge representation
 * Automated reasoning
 * Machine learning
 * Computer vision (Only in full turing test)
 * Robotics        (Only in full turing test)
 
The diciplines above cover most of AI and the test is still relevant 60 years later.

*Universal Turing machine
 * Hypotetical device capable of solving any effectively solvable algorithmic problem
 * Any problem any langauge any computer is also solvable by a Turing machine
