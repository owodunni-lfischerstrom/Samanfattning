#Chapter 2, Intelligent Agents

##Rationallity and enviroments

 A rational agent is an agent that always does the right thing given what it knows and it goals.

* Rationality depends on four things
  * External preformence measure
  * Knowledge of the enviroment
  * Actions that can be preformed
  * Memory, percept sequence, what the agent has percived so far

* Diffrent enviromental characteristics 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Fully observable|Partially observable|How much can the agents sensors percive|
|Single agent|Multiple agents||
|Deterministic|Stochastic|Do we know for sertain what our actions do|
|Episodic|Sequential|Does our past effect our future|
|Static|Dynamic|Turnbased?|
|Discrete|Continous||
|Known|Unknown|Do we have to learn how the physics of the world|

##Agent types

* Simple reflex agent
 * No memory
 * Only reacts to changes of sensor data
 * Given actions by given sensor data
 
* Model based reflex agent
 * Memory
 * Can store knowledge of the woeld
 * Reacts to knowledge and sensor reflexes
 * No reasoning only hardcoded reflexes
 
* Goal-based agent
 * Memory
 * Can anticipate outcome of actions
 * Takes actions that are most likely to lead to goal (planing)
 * Capable of reasoning and deduction

* Utility-based agent
 * Memory 
 * PlaningÂ¨
 * Reasoning and deduction
 * Reasoning about several goals, trade offs, conflicting goals
 
*Learning agent
 * Can modify it's behavior 
 * Exploration leads to adaptivity to new experiences
